- Hello! I'm Terell Bernard Davis, a dedicated Computer Engineering student on the brink of graduation from Georgia Southern University.
My academic journey has been a blend of innovation, technology, and creativity, leading me towards specializing in a domain where precision meets passion.
				
- My fascination with technology extends beyond the classroom, diving into the realm of home networking and server hosting. From managing video game servers to running a media sharing website like Plex, each project is a new adventure. 

- My curiosity didn't stop there; I ventured into the world of automation and found a drive that pushes me to streamline and innovate continually.
					
- When I'm not tangled in wires or coding away, I express myself through music, playing the guitar and saxophone. These hobbies not only provide a creative outlet but also balance my technical pursuits with melodious harmony.
